# Claspo Popup Builder: Free Forever Plan, 1000+ Templates, Boost Conversions Up to 400%

Picture this: you've built a gorgeous website, traffic's flowing in, but visitors keep bouncing without a trace. They browse, they scroll, they ghost. Sound familiar? That's where Claspo walks in—a no-code popup builder that's basically the friend who knows exactly when to jump into a conversation.

I stumbled across Claspo while helping a buddy fix his Shopify store's terrible conversion rate. He was losing sleep over abandoned carts and a newsletter list that grew slower than a houseplant. Within an hour of tinkering with Claspo's drag-and-drop editor, we had a gamified spin-the-wheel popup running. The result? His email list exploded by 47% in the first week. No jokes.

## What Actually Is Claspo?

Claspo is a popup and widget builder designed for people who'd rather spend time growing their business than wrestling with code. Think of it as your conversion-optimization sidekick—one that comes with over 1,000 pre-made templates, works seamlessly with WordPress and Shopify, and won't charge you a penny to start.

What makes it interesting is the balance. It's simple enough that you can launch a campaign in ten minutes, yet powerful enough to target visitors based on their behavior, location, device, and about seventeen other parameters. Plus, there's gamification—scratch cards, fortune wheels, gift boxes—that reportedly increase opt-ins by up to 400% compared to boring old email forms.

The real kicker? Their free plan is actually free forever. Not "free for 14 days then we hit you with a credit card form." Just... free. With full features. I was skeptical too.

## The Stuff That Actually Matters

### Templates That Don't Look Like Everyone Else's

Claspo's template library houses 1,000+ designs. Not 1,000 variations of the same tired "Subscribe now!" box, but actual variety—from subtle floating bars to full-screen takeovers, exit-intent offers to seasonal campaigns.

What caught my attention: you can filter by use case (lead gen, sales, feedback), industry, and even holiday themes. Need a Black Friday countdown popup? Done. Cart abandonment recovery? They've got seventeen templates for that. The designs look modern without trying too hard, which is more than I can say for most popup tools.

### The Drag-and-Drop Editor (That Actually Works)

I've tested enough "intuitive" editors to know most are lying. Claspo's is different. Click anything, and your styling options appear on the right. Want to change button colors? One click. Add a countdown timer? Drag it in. Swap images? Upload or pick from their library.

The mobile view editing is particularly clever—you can hide elements or adjust layouts specifically for phones without breaking the desktop version. Given that half your traffic probably comes from mobile anyway, this isn't just nice to have. It's essential.

### Gamification Features That Convert

Here's where things get fun. Claspo offers three gamified widgets:

**Spin to Win wheels** – Visitors spin for a chance at discounts. According to their data, these drive 41% more conversions than countdown timers.

**Scratch Cards** – Perfect for mobile users. Scratch to reveal prizes. Conversions reportedly jump by 300%.

**Gift Boxes** – Click to "unwrap" a reward. These allegedly triple conversion rates over standard forms.

The smart part? You control the prize pool. Set probabilities for each reward—50% get 5% off, 25% get 10% off, 10% get free shipping. You decide what you can afford to give away, and Claspo handles the rest.

### Targeting That Borders on Mind-Reading

Generic popups annoy people. Claspo lets you show the right message to the right person at the right moment:

- **Behavioral triggers**: Time on page, scroll depth, exit intent, inactivity
- **Audience segmentation**: New vs. returning visitors, device type, geographic location
- **Advanced targeting**: UTM parameters, URL rules, cookies, local storage, even Shopify cart data

One use case I've seen work well: show first-time visitors a welcome discount after they've spent 20 seconds browsing. For returning visitors? Display a "Welcome back!" message with product recommendations. Same site, totally different experience.

## Pricing: Actually Transparent for Once

Most SaaS pricing is a maze designed to confuse you into picking a more expensive plan. Claspo's is refreshingly straightforward.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price | Pageviews | Websites | Active Widgets | Team Members | Key Features |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Free** | $0 | $0 | 30,000 | 1 | 3 | 1 | All features, templates, integrations included. "Powered by Claspo" badge displayed |
| **Basic** | $10 | $100 (save $20) | 100,000 | 1 | 5 | 1 | No branding, perfect for small sites just getting started |
| **Lite** | $20 | $200 (save $40) | 250,000 | 1 | Unlimited | 1 | Great for growing businesses with increasing traffic |
| **Advanced** | $30 | $300 (save $60) | 250,000 | 5 | Unlimited | 3 | Multiple sites, small team collaboration |
| **Pro** | $50 | $500 (save $100) | 500,000 | Unlimited | Unlimited | 10 | For agencies and larger businesses, priority support |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Custom | Unlimited | Unlimited | Custom | White label, dedicated support, custom contracts |

**Extra pageviews**: If you exceed your plan's limit, you can add more starting at $10 per million pageviews.

**Money-back guarantee**: 30 days for monthly plans, 100 days for annual plans. No questions asked.

Annual plans effectively give you two free months, which is a nice perk if you're planning to stick around.

## Integrations: Plays Well With Others

Claspo connects with the tools you're probably already using:

**E-commerce**: Shopify, WooCommerce, Adobe Commerce
**CMS**: WordPress, Wix, Webflow
**Email Marketing**: Mailchimp, Klaviyo, ActiveCampaign, GetResponse, Brevo, MailerLite, SendGrid
**CRM**: HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive
**Analytics**: Google Analytics 4, Facebook Pixel
**Automation**: Zapier, webhooks for custom integrations

Setup is typically copy-paste-done. For WordPress, there's a dedicated plugin. For Shopify, it's an app. For everything else, you drop in a script via Google Tag Manager or directly into your site's header.

The data flows automatically. Someone fills out a popup form? Their info lands in your ESP or CRM instantly. No double entry, no CSV exports, no headaches.

## Real People, Real Results

Let's talk about what users actually say, because marketing copy can only tell you so much.

**Serhii I.** (Owner, IT): "It's very easy to set up pop-ups to show special offers, promos etc. Claspo improved our conversion rates. Everything's great!"

**Anna K.** (Business Development Manager): "The exemplary feature of Claspo is its seamless integration with our other solutions. Its utility is particularly pronounced in facilitating review acquisition via their exit-intent pop-ups."

**Gene5377** (recent review, January 2026): "Claspo is an absolute game-changer for growing your email list and boosting conversions. The drag-and-drop editor is incredibly intuitive, with over 1,000 professional templates to choose from."

On Trustpilot, users mention the AI translation feature as a standout—automatically translating widgets into 90+ languages based on visitor browser settings. For businesses with international audiences, this saves significant time.

The most common praise? Speed of setup and quality of support. The most common complaint? Some users on lower-tier plans wish for higher pageview limits.

Overall ratings hover around 4.7-4.9 out of 5 across G2, Capterra, and ProductHunt.

## Use Cases That Actually Work

### E-commerce Stores

Cart abandonment is a killer. Claspo's exit-intent popups can catch leaving visitors with last-second offers—free shipping, 10% off, or even just "Are you sure?" messages. One Shopify user reported reducing cart abandonment significantly after implementing exit-intent discount popups.

### SaaS Companies

Offer free trials or product demos through targeted popups. Show different messages to visitors coming from paid ads versus organic search. Collect feedback through NPS surveys to improve your product.

### Content Sites & Blogs

Grow your email list with lead magnets. Offer a free ebook, checklist, or resource in exchange for an email address. Use scroll-triggered popups to show the offer after visitors have engaged with your content.

### Service Businesses

Collect bookings, appointments, or consultation requests through embedded forms. Use callback widgets to let potential clients reach you instantly. Display testimonials to build trust at key decision points.

### Agencies

The Advanced and Pro plans support multiple websites and team members. Manage all your client sites from one dashboard. White-label option available in Enterprise plan.

## What It Can't Do (And Why That's Okay)

Claspo doesn't generate unique coupon codes natively—you'll need to create codes in your e-commerce platform first, then display them through Claspo widgets. This might be a dealbreaker if you need automatic unique code generation.

It's also not a full marketing automation platform. You won't be building complex email sequences or running A/B tests across your entire marketing stack. But that's not what it's designed for. It does popups and widgets really well, and integrates with tools that handle the rest.

The free plan's 30,000 pageview limit might feel restrictive for busier sites, but that's roughly 1,000 daily visitors—enough for most small to medium sites to test things out.

## Who Should Try Claspo?

**Definitely worth trying if you:**
- Run a Shopify or WordPress site losing visitors without capturing leads
- Want to test gamification without spending thousands on custom development
- Need popup campaigns running in hours, not weeks
- Are tired of paying for popup tools with limited features on "free" plans
- Manage multiple sites (agencies, freelancers)

**Probably not a fit if you:**
- Need automatic unique coupon code generation (use OptimOnk or similar instead)
- Have under 100 monthly visitors (focus on traffic first)
- Want an all-in-one marketing platform (Claspo is specifically for popups)

## The Bottom Line

Claspo delivers what it promises: a genuinely free-to-start popup builder with professional features, modern templates, and enough power to handle sophisticated targeting without requiring a PhD in marketing automation.

The free forever plan isn't a gimmick—it's fully functional, just limited to three active widgets and 30,000 pageviews. For many sites, that's enough to make a meaningful difference in conversions.

What impressed me most wasn't any single feature, but how thoughtfully everything fits together. The editor is actually intuitive. The templates look current. The targeting options are comprehensive without being overwhelming. The integrations work. The support responds.

It's rare to find a tool that manages to be both beginner-friendly and genuinely capable. Claspo pulls it off.

If you've been putting off adding popups because it seemed too technical, too expensive, or too annoying to set up, Claspo removes all three excuses. The free plan costs nothing to try, takes minutes to set up, and might just turn those anonymous visitors into actual subscribers and customers.
